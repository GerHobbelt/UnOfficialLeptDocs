<p>Binary morphology is set of fundamental operations on binary images
(2-D sets of boolean values). It is a very simple, nonlinear
convolution-like operation between two such sets. Unlike linear
convolution, morphology takes the Min and Max of elements in the set.
One set is the image <em>per se</em>; the other is the kernel of the
convolution, which is called a <em>structuring element</em> and has a defined
<em>origin</em> (sometimes called the &#8220;center&#8221;). Binary morphology is
extremely important for fast, low-level image matching operations &#8212;
every commercial &#8220;machine vision&#8221; system has it because of its
usefulness. Back in the period around 1990, if you wanted to do fast
pattern matching, you could buy such a system from any one of several
firms (see below). These implemented binary morphological operations
on custom systems with wide registers at about 1 billion pixel
operations/second. Today, using the destination word accumulation
method (implemented in Leptonica) on a 1 GHz CPU, you can do binary
morphology up to an order of magnitude faster! So if you need fast
matching operations on binary images, read on. And if you are doing
image analysis on grayscale or color images, binary morphology can
often be used to give quick and spatially detailed &#8220;answers&#8221; to
questions of interest.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">What is binary morphology?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-binary-morphology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are familiar with morphological image processing, you can skip
this section.</p>
<p>There are many fields, such as computational linguistics, materials
science and biology, that use the term &#8220;morphological&#8221; to describe the
objects they study. To distinguish itself from these, morphological
image processing is sometimes called &#8220;image morphology&#8221; and
&#8220;mathematical morphology,&#8221; the latter perhaps to indicate the degree
of abstractness that has been achieved. Image morphology was pioneered
in France in the 1960s by Matheron and Serra, and further developed in
Europe thereafter. But until the early 1990s, most image processing in
the U.S. was linear: linear convolution and invertible transforms.
Heavy mathematical machinery can be brought to bear on such linear
processing, but there are many situations where non-linear image
processing is required, especially in <em>image analysis</em> applications
where decisions need to be made. (You can&#8217;t make decisions with linear
operations, which don&#8217;t allow you to say &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; &#8212; only degrees
of &#8220;maybe&#8221;.) The neglect in the U.S. of these fundamental nonlinear
operations reminds me of the old joke about someone who loses his keys
at night but only searches for them under a lamp-post because &#8220;that&#8217;s
where the light is.&#8221; I believe that the first doctoral thesis on image
morphology in the U.S. was the 1985 work on nonlinear filters by
Petros Maragos with Ron Schafer at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>Around that time, several &#8220;machine vision&#8221; companies were founded in
Michigan, largely to provide automated inspection for local auto
manufacturers. Binary morphology was used as a principal technique
because it is fast, memory efficient and provides general routines for
pattern matching. These companies sold special purpose hardware
because it was lucrative and it was difficult to put the algorithms on
general purpose machines. Why was that? After all, the Motorola 68020
was available in 1985 and the Intel 386 was available in 1986. Each of
these supported memory-protected multiprocessing with 32 bit
addressing. The main problem was that DOS and Intel lived in a 16 bit
world, using a 64K segmented memory model, and it was difficult to
handle larger images. And the unix workstations that were built around
the 68020 were relatively expensive. They were also slow &#8212; these
chips ran at a few MHz, several hundred times slower than the
ubiquitous 3 GHz chips you can buy for $100 today. These machine
vision systems were also popular because they were designed to be
special purpose &#8220;turn-key&#8221; systems (though it was not always easy to
turn the key, especially when you programmed them in an assembly-like
language.) And so, into the early &#8216;90s, there was a market for this
special purpose hardware. But the inexorable progress of the basic PC
microprocessor, both in speed and in software tools for program
development, has greatly reduced the demand for these special systems
&#8211; just as Silicon Graphics found that its business with special
purpose graphics hardware was obliterated by cheap, fast Intel and AMD
chips with gigaflop graphics performance. Today, processors are fast,
memory is cheap, and we can use binary morphology for pattern matching
at speeds that were not imagined even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Binary morphology is about operations on sets. The sets are ON (black)
pixels in a 2-dimensional image. As with all image processing
operations, there is a <em>source</em> image that is operated on to produce a
<em>destination</em> image. In the following, we use one set of conventions
to describe the erosion and dilation operations as set operations.
Other conventions exist, and you should keep this in mind when you
read the literature.</p>
<p id="structuring-element">The basic binary morphology operations are <em>dilation</em> and <em>erosion</em>. In
a binary image, we refer to the foreground (black) pixels variously as
&#8220;black&#8221;, &#8220;foreground&#8221;, &#8220;ON&#8221; or &#8220;1&#8221;. We refer to the background (white)
pixels variously as &#8220;white&#8221;, &#8220;background&#8221;, &#8220;OFF&#8221; or &#8220;0&#8221;. Loosely
speaking, dilation &#8220;smears&#8221; the foreground and erosion &#8220;thins&#8221; the
foreground. These two operations are actually <em>dual</em> in that an erosion
of the foreground is equivalent to a dilation of the
background. Dilation can be implemented as follows: start with a cleared
destination image (all OFF pixels). Then do a sequence of logical OR
operations of the source image with the destination, each time with a
specific shift, as determined by a pattern called a <em>structuring
element</em> (<em>Sel</em>). The <em>Sel</em> is a 2-dimensional pattern of <em>hits</em>, all
relative to an <em>origin</em> that is often referred to as the <em>center</em> of the
<em>Sel</em>. It is a set as well. So there are really two sets involved in a
morphological operation: the image and a <em>Sel</em>.  For example, consider a
<em>Sel</em> that is a horizontal pattern of 5 contiguous <em>hits</em> (x,y) =
{(-2,0), (-1,0), (0,0), (1,0) and (2,0)}, with an origin at (0,0). Then
a dilation of the image by this <em>Sel</em> involves initializing all dest
pixels to OFF and then ORing the source five times with source shifts
given by the five hits in the <em>Sel</em>.</p>
<p>An erosion can be implemented in a similar way. For example, you can
initialize all dest pixels to ON and then do a set of logical ANDs
between the dest and the shifted source. But there is one important
difference: you take the shift to be <em>from the hit to the Sel origin</em>,
rather than from the origin to the hit. You can think of the <em>Sel</em> as a
set of vectors in two dimensions, and for erosion, you use an
<em>inversion</em> of these vectors. Because of the AND, you end up with ON
pixels in the destination only where the hits of the <em>Sel</em> can <em>all</em> fit
on the ON pixels of the source image. In fact, the erosion can be
implemented by placing the <em>Sel</em> with its origin at every ON pixel in
the source image and, for every location where all hits in the <em>Sel</em> are
placed on ON pixels in the image, an ON pixel is produced in the
destination at the location of the <em>Sel</em> origin. Thus, the erosion is a
<em>pattern matching</em> operation. The inversion of the <em>Sel</em> for erosion is
required to make the erosion a dual of the dilation. The prescription
for erosion just given is oversimplified; see the discussion in the next
section on boundary conditions.</p>
<p>The inversion of the <em>Sel</em> for erosion is also required to make the
<em>opening</em>, which is a sequence of erosion followed by dilation, both
using the same <em>Sel</em>, have the property called <em>idempotence</em>. This
means that if you do a second opening, there is no change after the
first one. Operations that are idempotent have a special significance.
The opening can be visualized as follows: <em>it gives you only those ON
pixels where the Sel is able to fit entirely in the foreground</em>. (The
erosion gave on pixels only at the <em>Sel</em> origin location of such a
pattern match. Then by dilating those pixels, with the same <em>Sel</em>, you
get <em>all</em> the pixels in the match.) So the opening <em>projects</em> out a
subset of pixels of the source image, and a second opening gives the
same result because the <em>Sel</em> fits in those pixels by construction.
The <em>closing</em>, which is a dilation followed by an erosion with the
same <em>Sel</em>, is also idempotent. It is the dual to the opening, because
you can do a closing by opening the background. Regardless of the
convention that is used to define erosion and dilation, the opening
and closing operations have a unique definition. All four
morphological operations have two important properties:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><em>Translational invariance</em>. The operation commutes with
translation: if you translate the source and perform an operation, you
get the same result as if you performed the operation first and then
translated the result.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Increasing</em>. If you have two images, one of which has a foreground
that is entirely contained in the other, then the results of a
morphological operation retain the same order of inclusion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike dilation and erosion, the result of opening or closing an image
does not depend on the location of the origin of the <em>Sel</em>. (This is
another reason for inverting the <em>Sel</em> for erosion.) A consequence of
this is that opening and closing have special properties besides
idempotence not shared by erosion and dilation. Namely, the opening is
<em>anti-extensive</em>, which means that the set of ON pixels after opening
is contained in the source image. Oppositely, the closing is
<em>extensive</em> because the source image ON pixels are all contained in
the image that results from closing it. The erosion and dilation do
not have these properties because the result depends on the location
of the <em>Sel</em> origin. For example, if you dilate an image with a <em>Sel</em>
that has a single hit offset from the <em>Sel</em> origin, the result is
simply a translation of the original image by the vector from the
<em>Sel</em> origin to that hit. For this case, are the ON source pixels all
contained in the ON pixels of the destination?</p>
<div class="section" id="and-there-is-more-to-morphology-than-translationally-invariant-increasing-primitives">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">And there is more to morphology than translationally-invariant, increasing primitives</a><a class="headerlink" href="#and-there-is-more-to-morphology-than-translationally-invariant-increasing-primitives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You might think that all important operations are translationally
invariant, but this is not true. For example, any operation that
scales the image size is not translationally invariant. For example,
if an image is reduced by subsampling, the resulting image depends on
the subsampling grid (i.e., on the specific pixels that are chosen to
represent the reduced image). A translation of the image relative to
this grid before subsampling can result in a different (translated)
image from that produced by subsampling at the original grid location.</p>
<p>There is another important morphological operation, the <em>hit-miss</em>
operation. It is a very general pattern match because it finds matches
to parts of the image that have specified OFF pixels as well as ON
pixels. For example, the lower edge of a horizontal line in the image
can be found with a hit-miss <em>Sel</em> that has a row of <em>misses</em> below a
row of <em>hits</em>. For a pixel to be set ON in the destination, all the
hits must be on ON pixels <em>and</em> all the misses must be on OFF pixels
in the source. (The operation is sometimes called &#8220;hit-or-miss&#8221;, but
the operation is really a hit-<em>and</em>-miss.) Thus in its most general
form, the <em>Sel</em> has in each location either a hit, a miss or a
<em>don&#8217;t-care</em>. The addition of misses to the <em>Sel</em> makes the hit-miss
operation very useful, but it loses the increasing property. (Can you
see why?). Consequently, it is not of great interest in set theory
because without a preservation of image ordering, relatively few
general statements can be made.</p>
<p>I should not leave you with the impression that this is all there is
to binary morphology. There are many other image operations, such as
thinning (with or without preservation of connectivity), that can be
formed by sequences of basic operations. There are also many nonlinear
transforms from binary to grayscale images, such as a simple distance
transform that labels the minimum distance from each pixel to a pixel
of opposite color. A more complicated nonlinear function labels
<em>connected components</em> (a set of pixels of the same color for which
each pixel in the set is adjacent, in either a 4- or 8-connected
orientation, to another pixel in the set) by computing a measure of
their &#8220;length&#8221; as the maximum, over all pairs of pixels in the set, of
the minimum distance between the two pixels, taken over all paths
between them that stay entirely within the set of pixels that
constitute the connected component. Further, all the binary
morphological operations can be generalized to grayscale, where the
dilation is a <em>Max</em> operation and erosion is a <em>Min</em> operation. (Do
you see how the binary dilation and erosion are a special case of
taking the <em>Max</em> and <em>Min</em> operation? With a binary image, the max
value is 1 and the min value is 0. An erosion places a value of 0 at
the <em>Sel</em> origin unless all the pixels under the <em>Sel</em> are 1.
Therefore, <em>the erosion selects the minimum of the binary pixel
values</em>.) And once you go to grayscale, the number of interesting
nonlinear operations explodes. For example, much work has been done on
image segmentation, typically using seeds and region growing. See the
literature for details.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-about-boundary-conditions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">What about boundary conditions?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-about-boundary-conditions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Why have an entire section on boundary conditions? Why not simply
adopt a mathematically elegant definition, and use it. For natural
images, where there is no <em>a priori</em> bias toward any particular
grayscale value for pixels beyond the image proper, this is a
perfectly reasonable approach. For document images, however, this can
give unexpected results.</p>
<p>What is the mathematically elegant definition? It is the one that
treats erosion and dilation as duals, even in the presence of
boundaries. We will call it the <em>symmetric boundary condition</em> (SBC):
extend an image by the min value (0 for binary images) for dilation
and by the max value (1 for binary images) for erosion. This gives
strict duality. To avoid confusion, we call the extra pixels that are
used to extend the image beyond its actual boundaries the <em>frame
pixels</em>.</p>
<p>However, for document images, there is a natural bias toward extending
the image with background (0, OFF) pixels, for both dilation and
erosion, because we typically have background pixels at the
boundaries. So we might want to handle the boundary conditions by
requiring that we get the same result as if the image were actually
extended sufficiently by 0 pixels, for all morphological operations.
This does not give strict duality between dilation and erosion, but I
find it preferable for document imaging applications. We will call
this the <em>asymmetric boundary condition</em> (ABC).</p>
<p>Erosion is thus different for SBC and ABC. Suppose you have a binary
image with all pixels ON. An erosion with a 3x3 <em>Sel</em> flips a 1 pixel
wide border around the image to OFF using ABC, and has no effect on
the image using SBC.</p>
<p>The most problematic operation on document images is closing. Consider
a document imaging application with binary images, and let&#8217;s take a
specific closing example. Suppose you have an image with one ON pixel,
located near the left hand edge at (x=5,y=50), in an image of size 100
x 100, and you dilate with a horizontal structuring element of width
21 pixels with the origin at its center. Here are the three cases:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><em>Closing using asymmetric boundary condition convention with no
added border pixels.</em> The dilation stops at the image boundary, and
you get a line only 16 ON pixels long (5 to the boundary, the original
pixel, and 10 to the right of the original pixel). The subsequent
erosion with a 21 pixel wide <em>Sel</em> removes it entirely, because there
is no location in which all 21 pixels of the <em>Sel</em> are covered by ON
pixels. Removal of the original pixel is not typically what you want
for a closing operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Closing using asymmetric b.c. with added OFF border pixels.</em> The
dilation expands the orignal pixel into a line of length 21 that
includes 5 frame pixels, and the subsequent erosion leaves a single
pixel, the same one that you started with.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Closing using a symmetric b.c.</em>. As we will see, this can be
implemented without any actual frame pixels being added. But for
visualization purposes, imagine there is a frame of OFF pixels for the
dilation, which expands the original pixel into a line 21 pixels long,
including 5 in the frame. Then change the frame pixels to ON and
perform the erosion. Because there are now an infinite number of ON
pixels in the frame, the erosion only removes the 10 pixels to the
right of the original pixel. The original pixel and the five pixels to
its left remain ON. (Remember, the erosion leaves the <em>Sel</em> origin ON
if all hits in the <em>Sel</em> are covered by ON pixels.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So we get three different results! The third result, where pixels can
be connected with the boundary by the closing, is the mathematically
correct one in terms of strict duality (SBC), but for document images,
does one really want the closing operation to close gaps from image
pixels to the boundary? The first result loses the original pixel,
which is also likely to be undesirable. Only the second result gives
us an image that seems intuitively correct for a situation where the
image seems naturally to be extended by OFF pixels because the
foreground pixels are assumed to be localized to the actual image
(without a frame). Note that the second result is <em>independent of the
location of the actual image boundary</em>. This is the reason that we&#8217;re
considering boundary conditions in some detail: I prefer ABC for
document images.</p>
<p>In Leptonica, you get to choose which convention &#8212; ABC or SBC &#8212; you
want to use. There is a function, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resetMorphBoundaryCondition()</span></tt>,
that takes one of two values, <em>SYMMETRIC_MORPH_BC</em> and
<em>ASYMMETRIC_MORPH_BC</em>. We initialize it to ABC, so that by default <em>all
pixels outside the image are assumed to be 0 (OFF) for both dilation and
erosion</em>. The disadvantages of this convention are that we lose duality
near the boundary, and have to be careful with closing. However, we gain
the condition that an erosion cannot bring ON pixels in from the
boundary onto an image that is mostly OFF near the boundary, as most
binary document image pages are. If you do a translation (which could be
implemented as either a dilation or an erosion by a <em>Sel</em> with one hit
that is not at the <em>Sel</em> center), and you don&#8217;t want to introduce a
rectangle of black pixels, you must use the convention that the image is
surrounded by OFF pixels. If you use SBC with such a translation, you
will introduce a rectangle of ON pixels in an erosion but not in a
dilation.</p>
<p>As you can see, the type of boundary conditions you want to use may
depend on your application. Most mathematicians would likely argue for
using SBC. However, these issues are introduced here because SBC is
not the only possible choice, and with Leptonica you can decide which
boundary conditions you want to use.</p>
<p>We discuss below exactly how we handle the boundary conditions. It
turns out that there is essentially no difference in implementation
complexity or efficiency between the two choices, for either of the
two implementations we give here. Those implementations are discussed
below: <em>full-page rasterops</em> and <em>destination word accumulation</em>.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">The rasterop implementation of binary morphology</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-rasterop-implementation-of-binary-morphology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A general rasterop is an image operation that combines a rectangle of
pixels of the source image with a rectangle of pixels in the destination
image, where the combination operation can be any of 12 binary logical
pixel-wise operations. There are also special case unary rasterops that
only affect a rectangle within the destination image. See the page on
<a class="reference internal" href="rasterops.html#rasterops"><em>Rasterop (a.k.a. Bitblt)</em></a> for details.</p>
<p>As described in the previous section, a morphological operation can be
implemented by performing a sequence of logical ORs (for the dilation)
or logical ANDs (for the erosion) of the source image, translated each
time according to one of the hits in the <em>Sel</em>. The rasterop can be
used, where the rectangle chosen is the entire source image. For all
rasterops, the source image is clipped so that it does not try to
write beyond any edge of the destination. There are other details, of
course, such as the initial conditions on the destination image and
the handling of the boundary conditions.</p>
<p>We have already introduced the issue of different conventions for
choosing boundary conditions for erosion. We can imagine implementing
<em>erosion</em> by rasterops in two ways:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Start with a dest image that is cleared (all pixels have value 0).
Copy the source image to it with a displacement given by (an
arbitrary) one of the hits in the <em>Sel</em>. For simplicity, imagine that
this copy is made without any shift because the first hit in the <em>Sel</em>
is at the <em>Sel</em> origin. The rest of the hits each result in an AND of
the shifted and clipped source with the destination.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Start with a dest image where all pixels are set to a value 1. For
each hit in the <em>Sel</em>, AND the shifted source with the dest. Because
we initialize to 1, you can use either a copy operation or and AND for
the first hit. This is dual to the implementation of the dilation,
where we initialize all pixels to 0 and do a sequence of ORs for each
hit in the <em>Sel</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use the second method because of its simplicity, and because it can
be used directly to implement erosion with both SBC and ABC.</p>
<p>Now, when an image is shifted to the right by 2 pixels, the leftmost 2
columns of pixels in the destination are unaffected by the AND. What
should happen to these 2 columns? It depends on whether you are using
SBC, which logically brings in ON pixels from the frame, or ABC, which
logically brings in OFF pixels from the frame. (But if we do full
image rasterops without a frame, nothing is actually brought in &#8212; the
2 columns of pixels are simply not altered.) If you are using SBC and
initialize the image pixels to ON, these 2 columns remain ON, just as
if you really pulled ON pixels in from the frame. If you are using
ABC, regardless of image content you must clear these columns out
later.</p>
<p>Suppose we are using asymmetric boundary conditions, where we require
that the result of erosion using rasterops is equivalent to a situation
where the source is surrounded by enough OFF pixels to cover the dest
for every translation specified by the <em>Sel</em>. Details on this choice of
boundary condition convention can be found in a recent paper on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://leptonica.com/papers/binmorph.pdf">Implementation Efficiency of Binary Morphology</a>. We have two methods for insuring that the pixels near
the boundary are properly cleared. We can <em>extend</em> the source image with
OFF pixels all around, and clip each rasterop to the destination
image. Then those columns of OFF pixels would automatically clear the
destination because of the AND operation. Or equivalently, without
embedding the source image in a larger image of OFF pixels, we can
perform all the rasterops in the erosion with usual clipping to the
translated source image and, as a final step, clear the (up to) four
rectangles of the appropriate boundary pixels in the destination. For
each such rectangle, the size in a direction normal to the boundary is
equal to the maximum shift (relative to the <em>Sel</em> origin) in the
corresponding one of the four directions. For example, if the maximum
shift to the right in the <em>Sel</em> is 4 pixels, the rectangle consisting of
the 4 left-most columns of the destination must be cleared. (Remember
that for erosion, the vector giving the image shift for each hit in the
<em>Sel</em> is <em>from</em> the hit location <em>to</em> the <em>Sel</em> origin.)</p>
<p>We must also clear the edge pixels for the hit-miss transform, because
it is a near relative of the erosion. The size of the rectangles to be
cleared is determined from the hits in the <em>Sel</em>, exactly as in the
erosion. The location of the misses in the <em>Sel</em> are not important for
the clearing operation because the pixels that would be brought in
from beyond the image boundary (if it were extended) would be ON. This
is because for each miss, a translated version of the <em>negative</em> image
is ANDed.</p>
<p>Suppose on the contrary that you wish to adopt the symmetric boundary
conditions; namely, that the image is surrounded with ON pixels for an
erosion, as discussed above. Then you simply use the second method for
the erosion given above: <em>set the dest image pixels (to 1); then AND
each raster operation, properly shifted and clipped. This operation is
dual to the dilation, and you stop there &#8212; you don&#8217;t clear the edge
pixels.</em> For closing, with the example given in the previous section,
we do not need to add any surrounding frame pixels for the rasterop
implementation. After the dilation, we set all destination pixels ON
for the erosion and do the set of ANDs from the source (which is the
destination of the previous dilation). Because of rasterop clipping,
it&#8217;s easy to see that the line of pixels from the original to the left
boundary will be preserved by the erosion.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, you can determine the boundary
conditions using the function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resetMorphBoundaryCondition()</span></tt>. The
effects of the boundary are most striking with the closing operation.
Closing is formally extensive, but with the ABC convention without added
frame pixels, ON pixels near the image boundary can be removed because
the dilation does not extend past the boundary. If you are using the ABC
convention, the function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixCloseSafe()</span></tt> will remove this anomaly by
adding a frame of minimal required size to every image before closing,
and removing the frame pixels at the end. The routines for adding and
removing a such a frame are in <span class="filesystem">pix2.c</span>. (In the libarary, we refer to
this as adding or removing a <em>border</em>). Note again that if you are using
SBC, closing will be extensive without the addition of actual pixels
around the boundary, and the anomaly will be avoided automatically.</p>
<p>The source code for the rasterop implementation of binary morphology

<p>Destination word accumulation (<em>dwa</em>) is a much more efficient method
of implementing binary morphology. We go through the destination image
one (32-bit) word at a time, computing its value based on the source
image and the <em>Sel</em>, and then write that word to the destination
image. This is more efficient than the rasterop version because the
inner loop for each destination word is unrolled into the simplest set
of operations, with no branches or iteration loops. Unlike the
rasterop implementation, the <em>dwa</em> requires specialized routines for
erosion and dilation using each <em>Sel</em>. However, it will be seen that
this is not an impediment to its use. Performance comparisons between
rasterop and dwa implementations of binary morphology can be found in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">an ISMM 2002 paper: <a class="reference external" href="http://leptonica.com/papers/binmorph.pdf">Implementation Efficiency of Binary
Morphology (pdf)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">an informal summary of that paper is also available in <a class="reference external" href="http://leptonica.com/papers/binmorph-poster.pdf">pdf</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid writing special case functions for words that are at or near
the image boundaries, <em>dwa</em> is implemented on interior pixels that are
more than 32 pixels from the actual image boundary. The outermost 32
pixel border of pixels within the image are read from but not written
to. If in an application it is desired to operate on <em>all</em> pixels in
the image, the user must add a border of frame pixels before doing a
<em>dwa</em> dilation or erosion. It is also necessary to add the frame
pixels with the correct initial color. For dilation, the pixels added
to the destination are always 0 (OFF). For erosion, they are OFF for
ABC and ON for SBC. This could be automated if the pix had a field
specifying the frame size, but I felt that adding this much machinery
to slightly simplify the use of <em>dwa</em> morphology was not warranted.
Just keep in mind that <em>dwa usage requires a border of extra frame
pixels if you don&#8217;t want to get get boundary artifacts, and you must
initialize the pixels properly according to the convention you are
using.</em></p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Auto-generated dwa code interfaces</a><a class="headerlink" href="#auto-generated-dwa-code-interfaces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We provide two implementations that automatically generate code for
<em>dwa</em> morphology.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Hit-only Sels</strong>. The function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fmorphautogen()</span></tt> in <span class="filesystem">fmorphauto.c</span>
takes a <em>Sela</em>, an integer and an optional filename, and writes the C
code for dilations, erosions, opening and closing, using each of the
<em>Sel</em>s in the <em>Sela</em>. The integer is used to give all functions a
unique name so that the C code created by multiple invocations of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fmorphautogen()</span></tt> using different <em>Sela</em>s will all compile and link
together in an application. For example, the program
<span class="command">prog/fmorphautogen</span> makes a <em>Sela</em> of the 58 <em>Sel</em>s that are
generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">selaAddBasic()</span></tt>, and generates dwa C code for the four
morphological operations for each <em>Sel</em>. It uses the integer &#8220;1&#8221; to
generate the code in two files: <span class="filesystem">fmorphgen.1.c</span> and
<span class="filesystem">fmorphgenlow.1.c</span>. We have compiled these files into the library. The
functions <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixMorphDwa_1()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixFMorphopGen_1()</span></tt> in
<span class="filesystem">fmorphgen.1.c</span> are then available to be called by any application to
perform a morphological operation:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>PIX * pixMorphDwa_1(PIX *pixd, PIX *pixs, INT32 operation, char *selname);
PIX * pixFMorphopGen_1(PIX *pixd, PIX *pixs, INT32 operation, char *selname);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The use of the first two arguments is standard, as described above for
the rasterop implementation. The operation is one of the set
{<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L_MORPH_DILATE</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L_MORPH_ERODE</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L_MORPH_OPEN</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L_MORPH_CLOSE</span></tt>}, and the <em>Sel</em> to be used is specified by the name
string (the selname) associated with that <em>Sel</em>. The list of allowed
name strings for the <em>Sela</em> is automatically extracted and placed in
the file <span class="filesystem">fmorphgen.1.c</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Hit-miss Sels</strong>. The function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fhmtautogen()</span></tt> in <span class="filesystem">fhmtauto.c</span>
takes a <em>Sela</em>, an integer and an optional filename, and writes the C
code for the hit-miss transform, using each of the <em>Sel</em>s in the
<em>Sela</em>. The parameter usage is identical to that of the hit-only
<em>Sel</em>s. The program <span class="command">prog/fhmtautogen</span> makes a <em>Sela</em> of the 6
<em>Sel</em>s that are generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">selaAddHitMiss()</span></tt>, and generates dwa C
code for the hit-miss transform for each <em>Sel</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>PIX * pixHMTDwa_1(PIX *pixd, PIX *pixs, char *selname);
PIX * pixFHMTGen_1(PIX *pixd, PIX *pixs, char *selname);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The code generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fhmtautogen()</span></tt> with index = 1 is in files
<span class="filesystem">fhmtgen.1.c</span> and <span class="filesystem">fhmtgenlow.1.c</span>, and has been put in the library.
The only restriction beyond size on the hit-miss <em>Sel</em>s is that each
one must have at least one hit; otherwise, the code generated aborts
with an error message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several other practical things to note about using the <em>dwa</em>
implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>You must add a border before dwa operations and remove it
afterwards</strong>. Add a 32 pixel border of frame pixels. For symmetric
boundary conditions, initialize the added frame pixels to 0 for
dilation and 1 for erosion. For asymmetric boundary conditions, always
initialize the added frame pixels to 0. The functions
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixAddBorder()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixRemoveBorder()</span></tt> in <span class="filesystem">pix2.c</span> have been

</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Higher-level autogen&#8217;d functions are provided</strong>:</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixFMorphopGen_*()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixFHMTGen_*()</span></tt> set the border

exist. If they don&#8217;t exist, pixels in the proper image will be
treated as border pixels.</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Limit on</strong> <em class="bold-italic">Sel</em> <strong>size</strong>. To simplify the code that automatically
generates dwa code, the hits in the <em>Sel</em> must not exceed 31 pixels in
any direction away from the <em>Sel</em> origin. The autogen code will
truncate any <em>Sel</em> that&#8217;s larger, and the generated code may not
compile. This limit means that with a centered <em>Sel</em> origin, the <em>Sel</em>
can not be more than 63x63 pixels. This should be sufficient for most
applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Higher-level functions for brick</strong> <em class="bold-italic">Sel</em><strong>s exit</strong>. These are

<p>With all the mechanisms set up for doing binary morphology with both
rasterop and dwa, and for doing <a class="reference internal" href="grayscale-morphology.html"><em>Grayscale Morphology</em></a>, it is
important to add some machinery to make it very easy to use for the
situation where the Sels are linear operators of all HITS, which is by
far the most common usage. These linear operators can be used in
&#8220;separable&#8221; combinations, horizontal and vertical, to implement
morphology with 2-dimensional rectangular Sels of all HITS. We call
these 2-dimensional Sels &#8220;bricks.&#8221; Large linear Sels, of which the

closing if chosen. They also handle all intermediate images
transparently, of which there are several for separable openings and
closings. And they don&#8217;t require the generation and destruction of
Sels, as they make them internally and destroy them after use. See the
notes at the beginning of <span class="filesystem">morph.c</span> for usage.</p>
<p>For the operations using 2-way composable Sels, consider
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixOpenCompBrick()</span></tt> as an example. The results are identical to to
the those of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixOpenBrick()</span></tt>, for sizes that are exactly decomposed
such that the product of factors in the former equals the Sel size of
the latter. We place constraints and penalties on the functions that
choose how to do the decomposition. The regression test

<p>The dwa brick morphological operations work on the set of linear Sels

dwa by the functions in <span class="filesystem">fmorphgen.1.c</span>. Look there to see which are
available. If for some reason you want some other Sel, such as sel_23h,
which is not there, you can follow one of the prescriptions set out in
<span class="filesystem">morphdwa.c</span>. However, you will likely find that you don&#8217;t need to do
this, because the dwa operations that use 2-way composable Sels will
implement a close approximation to sel_23h. For convenience, if you call
the non-composite dwa version, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixCloseBrickDwa()</span></tt>, and the
Sel doesn&#8217;t exist for it, it will automatically call the 2-way composite
dwa version, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixCloseCompBrickDwa()</span></tt>.</p>

<p>To make these atomic functions even simpler to use, we provide
interpreters for sequences of morphological operations. For binary
morphology, these sequences are combined with rank reductions and
replicative expansion. All the interpreters are in <span class="filesystem">morphseq.c</span>. The
morphological operations enabled by the sequences all use separable
brick Sels. As with the atomic brick dwa functions, the interpreters
reduce the complexity of using a dwa implementation to a single
function invocation with a simple interface.</p>
<p>How do we test all this? A large regression test,
<span class="filesystem">prog/binmorph1_reg.c</span>, tests all the binary brick operations,
including the 2-way Sel decomposition, along with their interpreted
sequences. Specifically, we test all morphological operations using:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">general rasterop</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">brick rasterop (unary Sel)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">morph sequence of brick rasterop (unary Sel)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">morph sequence of composite brick rasterop</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">brick dwa</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">morph sequence of brick dwa</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">morph sequence of composite brick dwa</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A second regression test, <span class="filesystem">prog/binmorph2_reg.c</span>, compares the results
of the 2-way composite separable brick implementations (both rasterop
and dwa) against the unary brick implementations. A third regression
test, <span class="filesystem">prog/binmorph3_reg.c</span>, compares rasterop brick (separable and
non-separable) with various implementations of separable dwa bricks.</p>
<p>Our default boundary condition is asymmetric (0 for both dilation and
erosion), but you can toggle this to test all functions with using the
symmetric b.c. as well.</p>

<p>Dwa implementations are typically about 3-5 times faster than full
image rasterops. The implementation is perhaps more complicated, but
no harder to use for the brick Sels.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A general Dwa operation on an Sel of all hits or hits and misses can
be made using the function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fmorphautogen()</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fhmtautogen()</span></tt>,
respectively. These functions take an array of Sels (a Sela), and
generate all the code required for any of the four basic morphological
operations. Two interfaces are given: a higher one that adds and
removes border pixels to avoid boundary effects, and a lower one that
assumes the border pixels already exist. The first is useful for
simple operations; the second for sequences where you don&#8217;t want to be
adding and removing borders multiple times. Once generated, the code
can be compiled directly with an program that uses it, or it can be
compiled into the library. Your choice.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Special functions, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixDilateBrickDwa()</span></tt>, have been written
for Dwa operations using separable brick Sels. Only a small number of
linear Sels have been compiled in. However, for operations where the
Sel doesn&#8217;t exist, the brick Dwa operation defaults to the composite
one (next).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Composite separable functions, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixDilateCompBrickDwa()</span></tt>,
have been written for all brick Sels up to 63 x 63. (Remember: a Dwa
Sel cannot have hits or misses more than 31 pixels on any side of the
Sel origin, so putting the origin in the Sel center, this gives a
maximum linear Sel size of 63.) Composable brick operations require a
sequential operation using a small linear brick and and extended comb;
the order does not matter. The characteristics of each are given in a
struct in <span class="filesystem">sel1.c</span>. The identical combinations are used in the full
image rasterop implementation, which is slower than the Dwa but has
the ability to go to arbitrary sizes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, much of the machinery is specifically targeted for
brick Sels. The reason is that in most applications, the vast majority
of morphological operations use brick Sels!</p>
<p>There are a set of 3 regression tests, <span class="filesystem">prog/dwamorph*_reg.c</span>, that
show you how to generate and use new Sels. <span class="filesystem">prog/dwamorph1_reg.c</span>
calls a function to generate all linear Sels (both horizontal and
vertical) from lengths between 2 and 63. This is a lot of code to add
to the library, so instead, it compiles and runs two other programs
with the code linked in. These programs are:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><span class="command">prog/dwamorph2_reg</span>. This runs a regression test comparing dwa
to rasterop morphology for all the basic operations and all 122 Sels.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="command">prog/dwamorph3_reg</span>. This runs timing for linear and composable
operations for both rasterop and dwa, for all the horizontal
Sels. The results are shown at the end of this section.</p>

<p>Performance of linear and composite operations for rasterops and dwa are
given in the four plots below. The time for each is given in
milliseconds for operations on an image (feyn.tif), which has about 8
million pixels (300 ppi scan on letter size paper). The operations are
done on <em>horizontal</em> brick Sels of lengths between 2 and 63.
(Operations on <em>vertical</em> brick Sels are considerably faster for
rasterop, but only slightly faster for dwa.) This data was generated
directly by <em>prog/dwamorph3_reg</em> on a 3 GHz P4, and should be
representative for those machines.</p>

<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="Closing time vs sel size" class="border align-center" src="../_images/close-time.png" /></div>
<p>There are several things to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The composite morphological operation times scales approximately as
the square root of the Sel size. The dilation starts above the others
because it is necessary to add a border for dilation to avoid boundary
effects.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The speed of dwa is typically about 4 times faster than full image
rasterops.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The time to do a dwa operation can be estimated from the fact that
dwa performs about 12 pixel operations for each machine cycle. For
example, a linear erosion of size 60 on a 8 x 10^6 pixel image reuires
about 5 x 10^8 pixel operations. A 3 GHz machine can perform about 4 x
10^10 pixel operations/sec, so the erosion should take about 13 msec.
The comparable composite operation (6 + 10 = 60) is expected to take
about 4 msec. As you can see from the plot, there is an additional 2
msec overhead for adding and removing a border, so the composite dwa
erosion takes about 6 msec, and the opening and closing require an
additional 4 msec (total: 10 msec).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em class="bold-italic">In summary, for the fastest operations on brick Sels, use the dwa
composite for sizes less than 64 and the rasterop composite for larger
ones.</em></p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Binary morphology and cellular automata</a><a class="headerlink" href="#binary-morphology-and-cellular-automata" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I can&#8217;t leave this subject without mentioning <em>cellular automata</em>
(CAs). Conway&#8217;s &#8220;Game of Life&#8221; is an example of a <em>cellular automaton</em>
(CA). In each generation (or iteration), a set of rules is applied to
a binary image to generate another image. Conway used a very simple
set of rules, where the value of a pixel on the next iteration depends
only on the number of ON pixels adjacent to it. Too few neighboring ON
pixels (starvation) or too many (overpopulation) caused the pixel to
be OFF (die) in the next iteration. The result was a complicated and
unexpected evolution of patterns.</p>
<p>Now I find it interesting that people only seem to use 2-D CAs. Not much
happens in 1-D. Using a 3-neighborhood consisting of the binary pixel
and its two neighbors in 1-D, you can have 2 3 = 8 different patterns,
each of which can have a rule that sets the new pixel value to either ON
or OFF. Thus, you can have 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 different sets of rules for
how each pixel changes in the next iteration. A large number, but
certainly manageable. But in 2-D, if your rule depends on the
3-neighbors, you can have 2<sup>9</sup> = 512 different patterns, leading
to 2<sup>512</sup> different sets of rules. That&#8217;s a very large set, much
too large to be usefully explored at random. With such large numbers, it
is easy to see that people might be impressed with the computational
power.  And the numbers continue to explode in higher dimensions. For
example, in 3-D, with a 3-neighborhood you have 2<sup>27</sup> patterns,
and approximately 2<sup>130000000</sup> different rule sets! I haven&#8217;t seen
anything done in 3-D, though I imagine it would be much more interesting
than 2-D, though much harder to show visually what is happening.</p>
<p>For amusement, you can see some interesting 2-D CA at <a class="reference external" href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/mcell/rullex_nmbi.html">this</a> web site. Each CA
is described by its rule, which enumerates the output pixel result for
each possible combination of neighbor pixels.</p>
<p>There is a simple relation between 2-D CAs and binary morphology. The
<em>hit-miss</em> operation is a rule that gives a <em>single pattern</em> of ON and
OFF pixels to be matched at each location, with the result that if the
pattern is matched the output value is ON, and otherwise it is OFF.
<em>Any cellular automaton can thus be built as a generalization of the
hit-miss operation, where in general more than one pattern is checked
for a match</em>. So in computational power, the hit-miss operation (thus
generalized) is equivalent to the cellular automaton!</p>
<p>Things get even more interesting. Alan Turing&#8217;s fundamental discovery
was that all programmed computers are equivalent to a very simple
<em>Turing Machine</em> that could read and write binary data on an
infinitely long tape. Any machine that is equivalent to a Turing
Machine is called <em>Turing complete</em>. And it is easily shown that
cellular automata are Turing complete. Consequently, the hit-miss
operator can be used to implement a Turing Machine! In principle, you
can compute <em>anything</em> with this generalized hit-miss operator!</p>
<p>People who have spent a lot of time with CAs tend to become captivated
by their power. I believe it is because the 2-D CA have both general
computational power and, at the same time, are able to show us the
computational evolution directly through our visual system, rather
than analytically in some abstract mathematical representation.</p>
<p>The laws of physics can be expressed in many ways; among them, a local
description of fields and their derivatives being the most common. The
fields, which can be related to physical measurements, are the
solutions to <em>partial differential equations</em>. These are solved on
digital computers, typically by discretizing space onto a lattice and
time into discrete increments, as a set of <em>difference equations</em>. A
very simple example is the Laplace equation for the electrostatic
potential in some region surrounded by a closed boundary on which the
potential values are known everywhere. The solution on the lattice
points inside is found by applying, over and over, a very simple rule:
<em>replace the value of the potential at each point by the average of
the four closest neighboring values</em>. This is a <em>relaxation</em> method;
eventually the potential at each point arrives at its final value. You
can implement this by a CA; for 2-D geometries, you can even implement
it on a spreadsheet! (You may be worried because the world &#8212; and
spreadsheet cells &#8212; appear to be described by real numbers instead of
binary numbers. We&#8217;ll sweep this objection under the rug by noting
that real numbers can be approximated to arbitrary precision by binary
numbers, patterns of 0s and 1s.) Because the laws of nature seem to be
expressible locally by such very simple rules, people naturally wonder
if the entire universe is, at the root, one big CA with some very
simple rules.</p>
<p>There are two areas of physics in particular that have proven to be very
difficult to explain, and that have recently forced physicists to
develop new fields of mathematics. One is elementary particles, where
things are not understood at the very small scales and mathematical
descriptions tend to blow up. The other is in the macroscopic regime
where we have particle interactions (e.g., in fluids) leading to complex
nonlinear behavior such as turbulence and associated chaotic
dynamics. In both cases, people naturally search for a set of simple
underlying rules to explain the complex behavior. In particle physics,
Wheeler speaks of the &#8220;quantum foam&#8221; at the scale of the <em>Planck
length</em>, about 10<sup>-33</sup> cm, where space-time itself is strongly
perturbed by quantum gravity. Can rules at that tiny scale, perhaps
given by a CA on a lattice, lead to the observed phenomenology of
particle physics at much larger scales such as 10<sup>-17</sup> cm?
Likewise, people have observed chaotic behavior arising out of 2-D CAs,
along with universal scaling parameters for the phenomena, such as
period-doubling in chaos, that arise from very simple dynamical rules
for the system evolution. So it is natural to hope that CAs can model
and perhaps even explain the most difficult fields of physics. And why
stop there? What about conscious intelligence, a mystery so slippery and
deep that the mind is completely boggled at its contemplation?  Could
<em>we</em> possibly be CAs?</p>
<p>Edward Fredkin, a physicist at Boston University, has spent much of his
career on the search for the rules of the universe based on the
assumption that space and time are discrete. A good introduction to his
thinking is his 1992 paper, <a class="reference external" href="http://leptonica.com/cachedpages/fredkin-cosmogony.html">A new cosmogony</a>. In 2002, Stephen Wolfram
published his Opus Magnus, <cite>A new kind of science</cite>, a 1200 page
treatise on cellular automata based on unpublished work he did over the
past 10 years. Wolfram, who got his PhD in physics from CalTech at age
20, has a history of brilliant work, including founding the company (of
his name) that makes Mathematica. Like Julian Schwinger, his motto could
well be &#8220;If you can&#8217;t join &#8216;em, beat &#8216;em,&#8221; but unlike Schwinger, Wolfram
is still in the game. I expect Wolfram to make some important
observations in this field.</p>
