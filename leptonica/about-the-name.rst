What is the Significance of the Name "leptonica"?
=================================================

|Leptonica| is the Italian word for "leptonic", which is an adjective
that refers to three very similar families of fundamental particles,
called *leptons*, of which the electron and its neutrino comprise the one
most familiar to us.

The name *lepton* is derived from the Greek, meaning "light" particle.
(This is in contrast to the "heavy" particles, such as the proton.)
The name was chosen in the '40s by Abraham Pais, a particle physicist
who, during the past 20 years, has written several excellent books on
the history of physics of the 20th century, including technical
biographies of Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.
