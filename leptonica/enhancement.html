<p>I&#8217;ve put a few operations here that are relatively simple and in wide
use for improving the appearance of grayscale and color images. Each
one will be described below. The first two, <em>gamma correction</em> and
<em>contrast enhancement</em> are trivial to implement because they only
require a lookup table to map from the source pixel value to the dest
pixel value. The last two, <em>unsharp masking</em> and <em>image smoothing</em> are
a little more complicated because they use some set of neighboring
pixels in the source to determine the dest pixel value. All four
operations work separately on each color sample, so the color
implementation for each one just uses its grayscale implementation
three times (once for each color sample). There are many other image
processing operations that can be included here, and they will be
added as occasion permits. If you have a favorite that&#8217;s not here, ask
me.</p>

<p><em>Image restoration</em> takes an image that has been degraded by some
known (typically statistical) process and attempts to regenerate
something closer to the original image. These methods are often
Bayesian, selecting destination pixels using a <em>maximum a posteriori</em>
procedure. The basic idea is very simple. You have a statistical model
for the degradation process, given as a set of conditional
probabilities for observing a specific degraded pixel when you started
with some original pixel. You also have an estimate of the prior
probabilities for the original image pixels (or groups of them). Bayes
law then lets you estimate the posterior conditional probabilities,
which are the probabilities that, given an observed (degraded) pixel,
you started with some original one; and you select the maximum of
these over the set of all possible original ones. By doing this, <em>you
select the original image pixel that is most likely to have produced
the observed pixel.</em></p>
<p>If the noise is known to be <em>sparse additive gaussian</em> (&#8220;sparse&#8221;
meaning that only a small fraction of the pixels are affected), an
obvious operation to apply is a <em>median filter</em>, which is very good at
removing outliers without seriously affecting other pixels. It is
nonlinear, has some smoothing effect, and tends to change pixels at
sharp edges.</p>
<p>For <em>binary images</em>, enhancement involves a number of operations, such
as removal of pepper noise. If the image has been scanned, cleanup can
involve deskew, removal of black pixels near the edge, and special
operations on binarized pictorial regions. The latter can involve
conversion to gray, followed by grayscale enhancement and halftone
screening back to binary. Many scanners give you binary output, and if
they threshold the pictorial regions without halftoning or dithering,
the result is a high contrast image where much of the gray information
can be lost.</p>
<p>If the image is a binary scan that is composed of connected components,
many of which are similar (such as text characters), it can be enhanced
on a component basis. Use the jbig2 clustering algorithms in
<strong>Leptonica</strong> to put all instances of connected components that are
sufficiently similar into the same <em>class</em>. Then from that set of
instances, generate a template with less edge noise.  This template can
be either binary or grayscale; the latter gives an improved appearance
because the edge pixels will be gray, causing the edge to appear
smoother. Then build the reconstructed (enhanced) image by substituting
the template image for each of the instances that were used in deriving
it. See the page on the <a class="reference internal" href="jbig2.html"><em>Jbig2 Classifier</em></a> for more details.</p>

<p>(<em>The discussion in this section almost certainly contains
inaccuracies. I will remove this caveat when I have sufficient
confidence in its accuracy.</em>) Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) have a
nonlinear response between current from the thermionic tube and
applied voltage. Plotted this way, the current has positive curvature
with voltage, which corresponds typically to a <em>gamma</em> of about
1./2.2. By this we mean that the output current is proportional to the
input voltage raised to the power 2.2. Low voltages have very low
currents. Now, because we want the response to be linear, so that what
we see on the CRT is the same as the actual image taken with a digital
camera, the cameras are calibrated to compensate for the display
device by having a gamma of 2.2. All pixels in the captured image are
lightened, with dark areas being lightened relatively more. It would
be nice if all display devices were calibrated so that they would
display images similarly. In a perfect world everyone would follow the
same rules, but Apple sets up its CRTs to have a gamma of 2.4.</p>
<p>But things get much more complicated with flat panel displays. Whereas
CRTs emit light from the phosphor that is proportional to the electron
current hitting it, flat displays use a white illumination with light
subtraction due to absorption in the dyes. Flat panels do not have a
built-in physical gamma to darken the image; consequently, images look
much brighter than on CRTs.</p>
<p>There is also a calibration for displays that has to do with the
relative amount of different colors used to produce white. This is
expressed by the temperature of the black body radiator that would
produce this color distribution. The standard is 6500 degrees K, but
manufacturers have found that if they use higher equivalent
temperatures, the displays are brighter, and the extra blue is not too
noticeable because the eye is relatively insensitive to blue. So, for
example, an inexpensive CRT may be calibrated to 12000 degrees K.</p>
<p>What about printing? If you print from a digital camera image without
using a gamma correction, the image will appear light and washed out.
So printing software typically compensates for the high gamma of the
camera.</p>
<p>From a psychophysical viewpoint, people experience intensity
logarithmically. Each doubling of the intensity is perceived as an
additive constant to the apparent brightness. Our eyes have a dynamic
range of about 10<sup>6</sup>, whereas your camera has a mere 8 bits
(256 levels) in each color. If the camera were linear, a scene with
both light and shadowed regions could have both the shadowed region
too dark and the light region washed out. The positive gamma built in
to cameras helps somewhat in this respect. The apparent dynamic range
in the dark parts of the image is increased, because more of the
actual range is assigned to these darker pixels. This gives the camera
a logarithmic response. Of course, the lighter part gets even lighter,
but not by as much.</p>
<p>So gamma mapping is used both to compensate for nonlinearities in the
display devices and to increase the apparent dynamic range. The output
is related to the input by raising it to the factor (1 / gamma),
properly scaled so that the end points are not adjusted. The mapping
function looks like this:</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="Gamma Correction" class="border align-center" src="../_images/gamma-correction.png" /></div>
<p>The plot was made using <span class="filesystem">prog/gammatest.c</span>. If gamma &lt; 1.0, the
image is darkened, with the biggest effect happening for the dark (low
input) pixel values. If gamma &gt; 1.0, the image is brightened overall,
with the largest changes happening again for the dark shadows.</p>
<p>We provide a top-level interface <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixGammaCorrect()</span></tt> in
<span class="filesystem">enhance.c</span>. For display on a CRT, depending on the source of the
image, you may want to apply a gamma in the range 1.5 to 2.0. For
printing, again depending on the image source, you may want to apply a
gamma that is less than 1.0 to darken the image.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contrast-enhancement">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Contrast enhancement</a><a class="headerlink" href="#contrast-enhancement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To increase the contrast, the pixels above some mid-value are
lightened, while those below are darkened. For an image that is washed
out, and still has too little contrast after gamma correction to
darken, using a gamma &lt; 1.0, the contrast can be increased by applying
a sigmoid-shaped mapping function to the input pixels.</p>
<p>How does one generate a sigmoid curve? One obvious way is to integrate
under a gaussian; this gives a set of curves with a single parameter.
Unfortunately, such an integral is not an elementary function, so
you&#8217;d have to use a table. As an alternative, consider integrating
under a lorentzian. The lorentzian goes as 1/(a<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup>), and consequently has large tails compared to the gaussian.
But the lorentzian integrates simply to the arctan function. This
makes a transition between -pi/2 and +pi/2 as the angle goes from
large negative to large positive values. Using a single parameter to
scale the angle, the result is to take a slice of the function
centered about 0. The parameter is just the width of the slice, in
appropriate units. As the parameter approaches 0, the width gets
small, so we&#8217;re using the arctan function near 0, which is linear and
hence sets the output equal to the input. As the parameter increases,
the contrast increases. The output is scaled and translated so that
the min and max values of input and output coincide (here, at 0 and
255). The mapping function looks like this:</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="Contrast Enhancement" class="border align-center" src="../_images/contrast-enhance.png" /></div>
<p>The plot was made using <span class="filesystem">prog/contrasttest.c</span>. See that file or the
implementation in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixEnhanceContrastGray()</span></tt> for details. Values of
the input parameter greater than 0.0 increase the contrast. (Values
less than 0.0 should decrease it; this is not implemented, however.)
The top level interface, which takes both 8 bpp grayscale and full
color images, is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixEnhanceContrast()</span></tt> in <span class="filesystem">enhance.c</span>.</p>

<div class="section" id="unsharp-masking-edge-enhancement">
<span id="unsharp-masking"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Unsharp masking (edge enhancement)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#unsharp-masking-edge-enhancement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When an image has been degraded by blurring, due to a low-pass filter in
the optics or subsequent image processing, the pixels most affected are
at &#8220;edges&#8221; where the intensity changes quickly in some particular
direction. These edges can be sharpened by running a high-pass filter to
emphasize the pixels near edges and then adding some of this back into
the image. It should to be done in such a way that the overall intensity
of the image is unchanged, and this requires that the high-pass image be
shifted downward to have an average pixel value of 0.  Then bright edge
pixels give values that are added to the original, whereas dark edge
pixel values are subtracted.</p>
<p>The method implemented here is called <em>unsharp masking</em>. The high pass
&#8220;edge&#8221; image is generated by convolving the image with an
approximation to a laplacian filter. In such a filter, the center has
a value 1.0 and some set of N surrounding pixels each has a value
-1.0/N. For a 3x3 filter, this would look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>-1/8   -1/8   -1/8
-1/8     1    -1/8
-1/8   -1/8   -1/8
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We implement this 3x3 high-pass filter by first generating a low-pass
image using a 3x3 smoothing filter:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>1/9    1/9    1/9
1/9    1/9    1/9
1/9    1/9    1/9
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and then subtracting it from the original image. The result is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>-1/9   -1/9   -1/9
-1/9    8/9   -1/9
-1/9   -1/9   -1/9
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which is identical with the laplacian given above except for an
overall scaling factor of 8/9.</p>
<p>Once the edge image has been generated, some fraction of it is added
to the original image. Thus, there are two parameters:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The size of the smoothing filter, given by 2s + 1. For s = 0, the
filter has unit size (support), and hence it is the identity. The edge
image is then 0, so there is no edge sharpening. The 3x3 filters given
above are used to generate the edge image when s = 1.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The fraction f of the edge image added back. Typical useful values
of f range between 0.2 and 0.7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The low-pass image is generated using the block convolution function,
which does the convolution in a time <em>independent of the size of the
filter</em>. The arithmetic is all done on 16 bit unsigned arrays, with
appropriate shifting to represent negative values. Details can be found
in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixUnsharpMaskGray()</span></tt> in <span class="filesystem">enhance.c</span> The top level interface,
which takes both 8 bpp grayscale and full color images, is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixUnsharpMask()</span></tt>.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Image smoothing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#image-smoothing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have included this for completeness, as image smoothing is one step in
the edge enhancement method described above. This is a low-pass
filtering operation. The top level interface, which takes both 8 bpp
grayscale and full color images, is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixBlockconv()</span></tt>. The method uses
an intermediate accumulation matrix so that the speed is independent of
the size of the filter. The filter is restricted to a rectangular kernel
of constant (normalized) height.</p>
