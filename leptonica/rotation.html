<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">How do you rotate an image by an arbitrary angle?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-you-rotate-an-image-by-an-arbitrary-angle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We provide two different methods for image rotation by an arbitrary
angle. One is <em>rotation by shear</em> (RBS), which chooses the value of
each dest pixel to be that of the source pixel closest to the location
the dest pixel came from (i.e., before rotation). The second is
<em>rotation by area mapping</em> (RBAM), which computes the value of each
dest pixel from the 4 source pixels from which it was derived,
suitably weighted by the actual overlap.</p>
<p>RBS has flexibility and speed advantages over RBAM. First, RBS can be
applied to images of arbitrary pixel depth, with no change in the
algorithm. Second, because it is implemented with horizontal and
vertical rasterops, an RBS is relatively fast &#8212; about 10 to 15 times
faster than RBAM in our implementations. And third, RBS is easily
implemented as an in-place operation, changing the pixel values of the
source image directly.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not the entire story. For grayscale and color
images, RBAM produces far better image quality than RBS. RBAM
naturally blurs sharp edges (an effect often called &#8220;anti-aliasing&#8221;)
so that stair-step &#8220;jaggie&#8221; artifacts are not introduced, as they can
be in RBS. Also, for large angles where you must use 3 shears, RBS
causes some extra clipping of pixels near the corners if the rotation
is about the center and the dest image is the same size as the source.</p>
<p>For applications where it is important not to lose any pixels due to
rotation, we provide a high-level interface, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixRotate()</span></tt>, which
embeds the src in a minimum-sized dest image so that no pixels will be
lost.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Rotation by Shear</a><a class="headerlink" href="#rotation-by-shear" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A good reference to RBS is <cite>A Fast Algorithm for General Raster
Rotation</cite> by Alan Paeth in <cite class="compilation-title">Graphics Gems</cite>, p. 179,
edited by Andrew Glassner, published by <cite class="publisher">Academic Press</cite>,
1990.</p>
<p>The mathematics of the rotation of a continuous image (i.e., an image
with infinitesimally small pixels) using horizontal and vertical
shears is simple. A horizontal shear moves a row of image pixels a
horizontal distance that is proportional to its vertical distance from
some reference point. A succession of 3 alternating horizontal and
vertical shears can be used to rotate an image perfectly by any angle.
For rotation by small angles of 0.05 radians (about 3 degrees) or
less, rotation can be performed using only 2 shears. Expressing the
rotation angle in radians, this 2-shear rotation induces a distortion
in the rotated image that is a change in the length to width ratio of
the amount:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
delta(length/width) = 0.5 * angle<sup>2</sup>
</pre>
<p>For an angle of 0.05 radians, this is about 1 part in a thousand, which
is typically not something you&#8217;d worry about. For larger angles, 3
shears are required. The details of the shear angles required for 2 and
3 shear rotation are given in <span class="filesystem">rotateshear.c</span>.</p>
<p>In-place rotation is performed by in-place shears. For a horizontal
in-place shear, each pixel row is translated to the left or right by
some number of pixels. Typically, several rows are translated together,
and <em>the pixels that are not over-written are filled in</em>. A similar up
or down translation of pixel columns is used for vertical in-place
shears. For shear, we give two choices for the color of the filling
pixels: white and black. (Henry Ford only offered black.) The &#8220;jaggies&#8221;
at sharp boundaries are visible because images are composed of pixels of
finite size, arranged on a square lattice. They arise because the two
and three shear rotations are nearest-pixel approximations to continuous
rotations.</p>
<p>An interesting result is obtained using a sequence of in-place rotations
with the same angle. The distortions introduced due to the finite pixel
size accumulate, resulting in a nearly random pixel diffusion if
repeated many times. For example, suppose you rotate an image six full
revolutions (2160 degrees) using 180 rotations of 12 degrees each. The
result is an image that is &#8220;encrypted&#8221; because of the pixel diffusion;
everything is blurred and a text image is not readable. However, if you
then <em>unwind</em> the image with 180 rotations of 12 degrees in the opposite
direction, you obtain the original image. Well, not quite. You get a
part of the image &#8212; a circular subimage that is equal in size to the
largest inscribed circle, with the circle center at the center of
rotation, that fits within the original boundaries of the image. You can
try this yourself, using <span class="filesystem">prog/rotatetest1.c</span> with the above parameters
on the image <span class="filesystem">test24.jpg</span>. See what you get. You can then recover the
central part of the original image by unscrambling the &#8220;encrypted&#8221; image
using an angle of -12.0 degrees. If you want to regain the entire image,
it is necessary before &#8220;encrypting&#8221; to first embed the original in a
larger rectangle that would contain the full rotated image at every
angle it is rotated through.</p>
<p>Because the underlying operation is rasterops, RBS works on images of
all depths, with or without color mapping. Speed plus flexibility, plus
the ability to rotate in-place, make RBS of ubiquitous importance. The
number of pixels/sec that can be rotated by RBS is inversely
proportional to the pixel depth. RBS rotates bits at a rate of about 1
bit in 3 machine cycles. On a 3 GHz machine, a 1 bpp image is thus
rotated at about 1 billion pixels/sec, and an 8 bpp image is rotated at
about 120 million pixels/sec.</p>

<p>RBAM is limited in application to situations where you have an 8 bpp
grayscale or a 24 bpp rbg image, you want the best quality rotated
image, and you can sacrifice some speed for quality. On current
computers, speed may not be an issue, as RBAM can rotate 24 bpp rgb
images at a rate of about 1 pixel in 200 machine cycles (about 15
million pixels/sec on a 3 GHz machine).</p>
<p>Area mapping works as follows. For each dest pixel you find the 4
source pixels that it partially covers. You then compute the dest
pixel value as the area-weighted average of those 4 source pixels. We
make two simplifying approximations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The areas are computed as if the dest pixel were translated but not
rotated.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The overlap area is computed on a discrete subpixel grid. Because we
are using 8 bpp images with 256 levels, it is convenient to break each
pixel into a 16x16 sub-pixel grid, and count the number of overlapped
sub-pixels.</p>

</ul>

<p>In the figure, f<sub>i,j</sub> is the value of the source pixel whose UL
corner is at the location [i,j] indicated. Pixel vertices are labelled
in standard [row,column] matrix notation. Coordinate values increase
as you move down and to the right, which is the standard for image
processing. Four source pixels are shown, each with their pixel value
labeled in its UL corner. Each source pixel is subdivided into NxN
subpixels; we show the subdivision only on one of the pixels. We want
to determine the value of the dest pixel whose UL corner is at
location V, which has coordinates x and y, in subpixel units, relative
to the UL corner of the upper-left source pixel. Taking the
contributions from the four source pixels in the order UL, UR, LL, LR,
the normalized average of the destination pixel, using area averaging,
is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Dest pixel value = (1/N<sup>2</sup>) [(N - x)(N - y)f<sub>i,j</sub> + x(N - y)f<sub>i,j+1</sub> + y(N - x)f<sub>i+1,j</sub> + xyf<sub>i+1,j+1</sub>]

<p>For RGB color images, area mapping interpolation can be slightly sped up
(by about 10 to 20 percent) using 4x subsampling (i.e., 16 subpixels),
inlining the code for the area mapping for each of the 16 cases, and
using the accurate coefficients for the linear interpolation. The
constants sum to a power of 2, allowing fast division. (We incorporate
the division into the re-positioning of each of the R, G and B
components into the destination pixel, so it takes no extra time.) As
usual, all operations are done on 32-bit quantities using
multiplication, addition and shift.</p>
<p>For most applications, the loss in accuracy (relative to the 16 x 16
subpixel version) is minimal, and the rotation speed for RGB images on
a 3 GHz processor is about 18 million pixels/second.</p>

<p>For <em>orthogonal</em> rotations of 90, 180 or 270 degrees, no interpolation
is necessary. They can be done by shears if the image is first embedded
at the center of a sufficiently larger image, so that no pixels are lost
when they are sheared. But it is also quite simple to do these rotations
by remapping the pixel locations &#8212; choosing the source pixel that
corresponds to each dest pixel and setting the dest pixel to that value
&#8212; and that is the method used here. Orthogonal rotations can be
checked by doing them consecutively four times (two times is sufficient
for the 180 degree rotation) and comparing the result with the
source. This comparison is easily done using an XOR between the result
and source images, and verifying that the result is &#8220;zero&#8221;; i.e., there
are no ON pixels.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">180 degree rotation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#degree-rotation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These are conceptually very simple: each raster line is reversed,
<em>pixel-wise</em>, and the lines are exchanged about the midline of the
image. The implementation is thus cleanest as a sequence of two
functions: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixRotateLR()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pixRotateTB()</span></tt> For the left-right
flip, the pixel access functions allow us to do this trivially. When
using these access functions, we do not use the SET function unless the
value returned from the GET function is nonzero. Therefore, not all the
dest pixels will be written, so <em>the dest image must be cleared prior to
the operation</em>. It is appropriate to clear the dest in the high-level
code.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the low-level part of the left-right shift operation in
more detail. For image depth &lt; 8 bpp, it is more efficient to extract
bytes and use a lookup table to reverse the pixels in the byte. This is
particularly important for binary images. However, because each raster
line begins on a 32-bit word boundary, but does not necessarily end on
one, before selecting the bytes for reversal, we must <em>right-justify</em>
the raster lines on the 32-bit word boundaries. This is most easily done
by shifting the entire image as a block, using an in-place horizontal
rasterop. The code for a binary image is:</p>

<p>The second rasterop restores the source to its normal left-justification
on word boundaries. The table supplied here reverses the bits in a
byte. For a 2 bpp image, a different table that reverses the four 2-bit
pixels within a byte must be used. Note that as mentioned above, if the
value of the byte is 0, we do not bother to write its reversed value to
the dest. Such tests before setting are particularly useful with binary
images of scanned text, where most of the image is background (white)
and the majority of bytes have zero value. This rotates each binary
pixel in about 5 machine cycles.</p>

<p>The 90 degree rotation can be either clockwise (cw) or counter-clockwise
(ccw). We specify the direction (1 for cw, -1 for ccw) in the function
call.</p>
<p>The 90 degree rotation, like the 180 rotation, is conceptually
trivial: we scan pixels in the source and copy them to the dest. As
with the 180 degree rotation, the dest must be cleared in advance. In
our high-level code, this is implicit because the dest is always
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">calloc</span></tt>\&#8217;&#8216;d. It&#8217;s usually convenient to organize the two loops by
considering the scan for the dest pixels, and one needs to decide in
which direction is to be the <em>fast scan</em>. If we&#8217;re simply plucking
pixels from the source, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. Either the source or
the dest will have a fast scan direction jumping through the image
data. This will cause secondary cache misses, resulting in main memory
fetches, but it&#8217;s not too serious and takes some effort to ameliorate.</p>

rotation we have the following simple algorithm:</p>

the index <em>i</em> label the dest rows; <em>i</em> is in the outer loop because it
is the slow scan direction. The fast scan direction, <em>j</em>, labels the
dest columns and the source rows.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="Fast scan destination row" class="border align-center" src="../_images/fast-scan-dest-row.jpg" /></div>
<p>However, particularly for binary images that have mostly OFF pixels,
the fast scan direction through the <em>source</em> image matters, because we
can eliminate all computation related to any source byte or word that
is 0. Therefore, we want the fast scan in the source to be horizontal
(i.e., by rows); this requires the fast scan in the dest to be by
columns:</p>

<p>This is illustrated as follows:</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="Fast scan source row" class="border align-center" src="../_images/fast-scan-source-row.jpg" /></div>
<p>Note that the index labels <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> have been switched from the
previous algorithm, because the slow-scan outer loop <em>j</em> labels the
dest columns, and the fast-scan inner loop <em>i</em> labels the dest rows.</p>
<p>To take advantage of situations where most pixels in binary images are
OFF, we must scan through the source in units larger than bits so that
we can easily test them. Two obvious choices are bytes and 32-bit
words. With bytes, it takes more work to make a decision, but because
of the smaller granularity, more bytes (in total) will be eliminated.
However, with typical images, it is more efficient to use 32-bit
chunks, and we do that as follows:</p>

<p>This is just an elaboration of the previous pixel-plucking code, but it
is typically <em>about 4 times faster</em>, rotating each pixel in about 7
machine cycles on average. We find the number of full 32-bit words in
the source line, and march over them. Each source word is checked. If 0
it is skipped in its entirely; this alone reduces computation by about a
factor of 2.5. Otherwise each of the 32 bits is tested and, if 1, is set
in the dest. We get another reduction factor of about 1.5 by shifting
and masking the word, rather than using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GET_DATA_BIT(lines,</span>
<span class="pre">i)</span></tt>. Finally, for each source image line, a scan is made over any
source bits not contained in a full 32-bit word.</p>
<p>We can actually make the binary 90 degree rotation arbitrarily
complicated. For example, to avoid pixel-plucking, by brute force you
can write an inner loop with lookup tables to rotate each 8x8 block of
pixels separately. Using 8 bit lookup tables, for each 8x8 block of
pixels, you need to extract 8 bytes from the source, construct 8
addresses from these bytes, perform 8 table lookups (each one generating
a 32 bit word corresponding to 4 of the 8 dest bytes), XOR the 32-bit
words in groups of 4 to get the 8 rotated destination bytes in two
32-bit words, and then set these bytes in the proper location in the
dest image. It&#8217;s not at all evident that such shenanigans are worth the
effort!</p>
<p>In summary, there are a few &#8220;angles&#8221; to rotation. RBS has flexibility
and speed. RBAM has accuracy, and for efficiency requires specific
implementations for each depth. Fortunately, RBAM can be made
surprisingly fast with relatively simple implementations. The orthogonal
rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees) have special implementations for each
depth. The 180 rotation is a combination of left-right and top-bottom
flips, with the latter being trivial and depth-independent.</p>
