This is Tom Powers' zip file that contains the entire `lib` and
`include` directories needed to build Windows-based programs using
static or dynamic versions of the leptonica library (including static
library versions of `zlib`, `libpng`, `libjpeg`, `libtiff`, and
`giflib`). The libraries are built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
32-bit. See his :doc:`developer package notes
</vs2008/downloading-binaries>` for version details, including where to
unzip this file.

.. _xtractlib-download:

Xtractlib
=========

This is a self-contained package that extracts C prototypes from C
files. It was a fun exercise (see grook above) in building a simple
parser with the leptonica string array (Sarray) utility. It is also
included in the leptonica library.

Version 1.4 (7/26/09)
   :sourceurl:`xtractlib-1.4.tar.gz`


.. _plotlib-download:

Plotlib
=======

This is a self-contained package with a simple interface to gnuplot, but
with no other dependencies. It is also included in the leptonica
library.
