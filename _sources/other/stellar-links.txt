.. epigraph::

   | We must expect posterity
   | to view with some asperity
   |   the marvels and the wonders
   |     we're passing on to it;
   | but it should change its attitude
   | to one of heartfelt gratitude
   |   when thinking of the blunders
   |     we didn't quite commit.

Urban Legends
   Millions of "Urban legends" are sent every day. How do you recognize
   one when it arrives? For example, you get a list of terrible
   injustices, each one where a criminal sues the victim (and wins!) for
   an injury acquired in the process of committing the crime. We
   obviously need *tort reform* . Or do we? Are we being had? The gold
   standard resource for getting at the truth is the `snopes
   <http://www.snopes.com>`_ web site.

Open Source
   Here is a selection of old :unconverted:`open source software links
   <opensystems-links.html>`, borrowed from various home pages. For a
   unique and entertaining set of views on the open source "movement,"
   you can start with a collection of Eric Raymond's `writings
   <http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings>`_ on his `home page
   <http://www.catb.org/~esr/>`_. This includes his :title:`The
   Cathedral and the Bazaar` and follow-on essays, as well as his new
   book, perhaps finally finished, `The Art of Unix Programming
   <http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/>`_. Raymond authored
   :title:`The New Hacker's Dictionary` and is a true *character*. His
   writings are required reading for anyone who wishes to understand the
   roots, influence and significance of the hacker culture.

Particle physics
   The Particle Data Group of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab provides a
   great set of `links
   <http://particleadventure.org/particleadventure/other/othersites.html>`_
   on particle physics. You can find excellent introductory articles,
   interactive websites with educational games, and the most recent
   experimental data. There is also a fine site maintained by Fermilab
   that gives `plain english
   <http://www-d0.fnal.gov/public/pubs/d0_physics_summaries.html>`_
   explanations of recent particle theories and experiments performed at
   Fermilab. Jatila van der Veen at UCSB has an unusual site with
   `educational materials
   <http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~jatila/index.html>`_ she developed for
   teaching physics and astronomy.

History of science
   Those of you with an interest in the history of scientific and
   literary thought and accomplishment will be well rewarded by visiting
   the `Nobel e-Museum <http://nobelprize.org/>`_. In addition to
   introductory educational resources such as an educational primer on
   the structure of matter, this site has biographies, presentation
   speeches, and nobel lectures of every honoree since the inception in
   1901!

Pseudoscience
   What is pseudoscience? How can you recognize it? What scams are out
   there? Here is a nice page on `pseudoscience
   <http://www.chem1.com/chemed/flimflam.shtml>`_ that gives a number of
   good links. Robert Park has written an interesting book,
   :title:`Voodoo science: the road from foolishness to fraud`,
   :publisher:`Oxford Press`, 2000, and he recently wrote an article
   giving a list of the :unconverted:`The Seven Warning Signs of Bogus
   Science <cachedpages/bogus-science.html>` (`original version
   <http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i21/21b02001.htm>`_).

Skeptic's Dictionary
   Assembled by philosopher Robert Carroll, the `Skeptic's Dictionary
   <http://skepdic.com>`_ is an informative, well-hyperlinked and
   well-researched web document on many topics of contemporary interest.
   Anyone with a femtogram of curiosity will find it easy to get
   absorbed in the articles.

Cargo Cult Science
   Feynman's pithy :unconverted:`1974 Caltech commencement address
   <cachedpages/cargo_cult_science.html>`, also reprinted in
   :title:`Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!`.

Linux computers
   If you're in the market for a Linux computer and are willing to pay a
   small premium for a good set of components and outstanding service
   whenever a problem arises, check out `Los Alamos Computers
   <http://www.laclinux.com>`_, run by mathematician and computer wizard
   Gary Sandine.

Internet Search
   `Google <http://www.google.com>`_, of course.

Google ~Guide
   Nancy Blachman has made an excellent `web tutorial
   <http://www.googleguide.com>`_, licensed under `Creative Commons
   <http://creativecommons.org/>`_, for search and other features
   offered by Google. It's worth spending a couple of hours going
   through, and if you want more background and tricks, she has
   co-authored :title:`How to Do Everything with Google` with Fritz
   Schneider and Eric Fredricksen.

Great essays and other fun stuff
   + `Paul Graham's essays
     <http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html>`_. Paul Graham is an
     original thinker, and his essays are written with clarity,
     simplicity and depth. Always provocative and original, Graham goes
     way beyond programming to some of the central issues of social
     organization and creativity. And you can buy the dead tree
     rendition of some of the best, :title:`Hackers and Painters`,
     :publisher:`O'Reilly Media`, 2004.

   + `Joel Spolsky's blog/essays <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/>`_.
     Joel Spolsky has written hundreds of essays since 2000 on software
     and many aspects of programming, design and related business. The
     essays are always well-written, thought-provoking and fun to
     read. To get a feel for his writing style and approach to
     programming, see this essay on `Making Wrong Code Look Wrong.
     <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html>`_ An
     outstanding set is collected in two books, :title:`Joel on
     Software` (2004) and :title:`More Joel on Software` (2008).

   + `Tales from the Mac development team <http://www.folklore.org>`_.
     These are anecdotes about some interesting days at Apple, neatly
     organized by categories, and recited by Andy Hertzfeld and other
     key developers. Some of it reads like Dilbert.

   + Larry Lessig's `Free Culture
     <http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/>`_. Lessig is one lawyer
     you don't want on the proverbial bus at the bottom of the lake. The
     creator of `Creative Commons <http://creativecommons.org/>`_, (a
     copyright mechanism for everything), his current ambition is to
     change the implementation of copyright law for the digital age. We
     wish him success.

   + `History of Burma Shave
     <http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles/waterman37.html>`_. A
     journey down nostalgia lane for old timers --- some of the best
     doggerel ever written.

A (true) fable for our time
   Ron Avitzur and Greg Robbins tell the `story
   <http://www.pacifict.com/Story/>`_ of how the graphing calculator
   came to be included with the Mac in 1994. Two engineers, in the face
   of gross managerial incompetence, and working in an Apple culture
   where defying authority was acceptable, refused to give up their
   dreams and did something amazing.
